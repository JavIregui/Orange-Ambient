# Orange Ammbient
Orange Ambient Website

### Brief
We are a company that makes long-lasting bicycle with an emphasis on sustainability.
We want to convey a sense of security, while at the
same time being down-to-earth.

You must create a website that will mainly make it easy to contact the company.
The goal is to emphasize the brand's values. Besides the landing page, the 
website will need a information page, shop page and a blog. The landing page 
should have a Our Values section. There should be a call to action to get users
to call for more information. They would prefer a trendy design, and would like 
you to use the brand color, which is green. Take into account the client's
preferences and values.
